Hi!

Thank you for purchasing this model.
Please note that the VRay version of this model uses the LWF (Linear Work Flow) as described on the chaosgroup forums,(www.chaosgroup.com). To use LWF you need to change 3DS Max's Gamma settings - please see the included file called "LWF_gamma_settings.jpg" to see what your settings should be. (You can change the Gamma settings in 3DS Max under: Customize >Preferences.) You also need to change the color mapping in your Vray settings, there are various options for this, I've shown one in the included file "LWF_VRay_Color_Mapping_settings.jpg"

3D genius lukx (http://www.lukx.com/) has made a simple video tutorial on LWF, it can be found here: http://rapidshare.com/files/16248248/LWFbyLukx.avi.html

VRay genius Aversis also has a brilliant tutorial about LWF on his website:
